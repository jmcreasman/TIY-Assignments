*How do I make API requests?*


What is the base URL for all requests?
https://openapi.etsy.com/v2

Are there any headers or query parameters required?
Name: `user_id` is rquired Type: array(user_id_or_name)

What kind of response should I expect?
Example:
```
{
  "count": 1,
  "results": [
    {
      "user_id": 5029420,
      "login_name": "EtsyStore",
      "creation_tsz": 1166740121,
      "referred_by_user_id": null,
      "feedback_info": {
        "count": 2559,
        "score": 100
      }
    }
  ],
  "params": {
    "user_id": "etsystore",
  },
  "type": "User"
}
```

*How does the API handle authentication?*


Do I need to authenticate? with user credentials?


What can I do with an unauthenticated request?


How can I authenticate my request? (what methods)
