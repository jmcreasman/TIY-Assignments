##Entry 1
The structure of a basic HTML tags are keywords (tag names) surrounded by angle brackets: <tagname>content</tagname>. HTML tags normally come in pairs like <p> and </p>. The first tag in a pair is the start tag, the second tag is the end tag. The end tag is written like the start tag, but with a slash before the tag name. If a tag is call an empty tag it means that it has no end tag.
###<!DOCTYPE>
The <!DOCTYPE> declaration helps the browser to display a web page correctly. To display a document correctly, the browser must know both type and version. So for example for html it would look like this; <!DOCTYPE html>.
###<!-- Comments -- >

###<html>
The <html> tag tells the browser that this is an HTML document. The <html> tag represents the root of an HTML document. The <html> tag is the container for all other HTML elements (except for the <!DOCTYPE> tag).
###<head>
The head element is a container for all the head elements and that can include a title for the document, scripts, styles, meta information, and more.
The following elements can go inside the <head> element:

Example:

###<h1>-<h6>
The <h1> to <h6> tags are used to define HTML headings. <h1> defines the most important heading. <h6> defines the least important heading.

<h4>This is heading 4</h4>
<h5>This is heading 5</h5>

<form action="demo_form.asp">
