# About JavaScript
## Basic literal types
### null
The Javascript literal `null` is an empty/singular value meaning that no object value is present (you either have it or you don't). When converted in a Boolean the return is `false`.
### Boolean
The Javascript literal `Boolean` has only two values true or false. These two values are the truest versions but other values can be converted in booleans. Null is always false. For Numbers 0 is false and all other numbers are true. Strings are true when there’s something in the quotes and false when there’s nothing in the quotes (also called an empty string).
### Number
The Javascript literal `Number` is a numeric data type; 1, 2, 3 etc. When converted in a Boolean the return is false for 0 and true for all other numbers.
### Strings
The Javascript literal `String` is a value that is used to represent text. It is always wrapped in either double quotations `"This is a story"` or single quotations `'This is a story'`. When converted in a Boolean the return is false when it's an empty string and true when there is content within the quotation marks.
## Basic Operators
### Arithmetic
These operators take a numeric value as their operand and return a single numeric value. The standard operations are addtion, subtraction, multiplcation and division.
####Addition
When given two `Number` values it returns the sum of those values as a numeric value. Example: 1 + 2 // 3
####Subtraction
When given two `Number` values it returns the differnce of those values as a numeric value. Example: 3 - 2 // 1
####Multiplcation
When given two `Number` values it returns the product of those values as a numeric value. Example: 2 * 2 // 4
####Division
When given two `Number` values it returns the quotient of those values as a numeric value. Example: 6 / 2 // 3
