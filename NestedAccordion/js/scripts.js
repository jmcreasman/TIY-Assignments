What does it do?
On this page the javascript opens and closes the accordions on the pages and presents the information displayed there from the html and css pages.
What interactive elements exist?
As stated above this page interacts when the user clicks on the arrowed headers by opening the accorion folder and displaying the contents. It must also close it when clicked again.
How do you interact with them?
You interact with them by clicking on the different headers.
What visual effects are produced by interacting?
The content in the accordion folder is displayed and a different arrow image is displayed as well to cue in the user that that folder is open.
What existing HTML elements are changed?
The arrow picture is changed.
What new HTML elements are created?
A new arrow image is presented and the body copy is displayed.
What CSS styles are used to produce the effect?
The copy color and font is from the css. The css also helps devide the js and html code into classes and divs.

//When the user clicks the header open the accordion
//Display copy
//When the user clicks the header again, close the accordion
//This code along with any nessary html and css code will be grouped into its own class id so that it will "activate" when hat class id is "called on"
//Some kind of if/else statement to do this?
//if (user clicks on header) {
//open accordion;
//}else {
//leave closed;
//}
//Then another similar statement to close it
//if (user clicks on header) {
//close accordion;
//}else {
//leave open;
//}
//I'm still fuzzy on how the DOM commands work but I believe they allow the user to interact with the web browser using the javascript so the js code that recognises when a user has clicked on a header will need to use some of them.
